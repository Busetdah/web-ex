                 Compound Feed
                  </h5>
                  <p>
                  The animal feed should be perfectly adapted to the specific type of livestock and their stage in live. This challenges the nutritionist to formulate recipes that make sure the final feed compound contains all the right nutrients in the desired quantities to allow it to be an easy digestible feed with an optimal feed conversion rate.
                  Feed millers are challenged to optimally process a large number of ingredients and ensure the desired feed quality while keeping capacity high and animal feed costs low.

                  <p>
                  We can help you to find that balance between feed quality and feed costs. With the input of your requirements and our engineering expertise and process know-how we are able to build your feed mill in a configuration that will give you a competitive edge.Equipment and installations for the Compound Feed industry form the heart of the company. Hammer mills with automatic sieve replacement, for example, mixers with bottom flaps for fast, residue-free emptying, meal sterilisation using heat treatment, and dosing installations for micro-ingredients with a very high dosing and weighing accuracy.
